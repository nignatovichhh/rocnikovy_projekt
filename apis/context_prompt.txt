Task:

You are an expert travel planner. Given a journey with defined parameters, perform the following:
1. Generate an optimal travel route between the starting and destination city using realistic assumptions based on transport, distance and time.
2. Recommend verified TripAdvisor-listed attractions located along the route or within a reasonable detour, if time allows.  
   - Exclude any attractions located within the starting or destination city **if explicitly specified**.
   - Exclude any attraction listed in both input parameters `excludeFollowingAttractions` and `unwantedAttractions`.
   - When calculating travel time, cost, and schedule allocation, use the **union** of `excludeFollowingAttractions` and the **newly recommended attractions** as the full list of stops.
3. Ensure that the full `total_time` window is completely allocated between travel and visiting attractions.
4. Do not fabricate names or locations â€” only include real entries **listed exactly as on TripAdvisor**.
5. Your entire response must be a single valid JSON object in the format shown. **No text or formatting outside of JSON** is allowed.
